# Algo Owls

Solutions should be included within the `solutions` directory and not in the `src` directory. Each solution should be included within its own directory inside of the `solutions` directory.

To meet the requirements of this project, it is necessary that solution files be included into the project with little to no dependency on the project structure. The intention of the CLI is to provide a convenient means for developers to execute and test their code. However, submissions for competitive programming must be standalone files or scripts. As such, all solutions included within the project must also be independent files that require a minimal set of changes to adapt for submission for competitive programming.

## Problem Sites

The most popular problem sites typically used by competitive programmers include:
- ICPC (Kattis)
- USACO
- Codeforces
- CodeChef
- Topcoder
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- Project Euler
- Advent of Code

Directories for these sites have been included. Feel free to include additional directories for other contest sites as you see fit. All such directories should follow a similar naming scheme of using a single word in all lowercase letters. This is done to be compatible with package naming conventions across languages.
