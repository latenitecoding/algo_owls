# Algo Owls

Solutions should be included within the `solutions` directory and not in the `src` directory. Each solution should be included within its own directory inside of the `solutions` directory.

To meet the requirements of this project, it is necessary that solution files be included into the project with little to no dependency on the project structure. The intention of the CLI is to provide a convenient means for developers to execute and test their code. However, submissions for competitive programming must be standalone files or scripts. As such, all solutions included within the project must also be independent files that require a minimal set of changes to adapt for submission for competitive programming.
