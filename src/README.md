# Algo Owls

The source code for `algo_owls` is shoudl be defined in the `src` dir. The CLI for `algo_owls` is defined as follows:

_Usage: algo_owls [[-s --solution] solution | [-h --help] | [-V --version]]_

Each solution should be included within its own directory inside of the solutions directory. See `src/solutions/README.md` for more instructions on how solutions can be included within the project.

To meet the requirements of this project, it is necessary that solution files be included into the project with little to no dependency on the project structure. The intention of the CLI is to provide a convenient means for developers to execute and test their code. However, submissions for competitive programming must be standalone files or scripts. As such, all solutions included within the project must also be independent files that can be imported into the project or require a minimal set of changes to adapt for submission for competitive programming.
